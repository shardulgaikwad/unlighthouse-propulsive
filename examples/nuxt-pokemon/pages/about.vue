    <h1>About Pokémon Pokédex</h1>
    <p>The Pokédex (Japanese: ポケモン図鑑 illustrated Pokémon encyclopedia) is a digital encyclopedia created by Professor Oak as an invaluable tool to Trainers in the Pokémon world. It gives information about all Pokémon in the world that are contained in its database, although it differs in how it acquires and presents information over the different media. However, they are also only given to a few Trainers at a time, generally to the ones that are felt to have exceptional potential and skill. Regional Pokédexes give information about Pokémon native to a particular region, while the National Pokédex records information about all known Pokémon.</p>
    <p>Pokédex entries typically describe a Pokémon in only two or three sentences. They may give background information on the habitat or activities of a Pokémon in the wild or other information on the Pokémon's history or anatomy. Pokédex entries also include height, weight, cry, footprint (prior to Generation VI), location, other forms, and a picture of the Pokémon.</p>
    <p>Sometimes the Pokédex might contain inaccurate or mythical information. For example, some of Tentacruel's entries describes it as having 80 tentacles when only 14 are visible.</p>
    <h2>In the core series</h2>
    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <p>The Pokédex is a handheld electronic encyclopedia device; one which is capable of recording and retaining information of the various Pokémon of the world. In order to accomplish Professor Oak's goal of a complete Pokémon database, the Pokédex is designed to find and record data on each Pokémon the Trainer meets. Pokémon are added to the Pokédex simply by encountering them in battle or, sometimes, by seeing a picture of the Pokémon. However, detailed entries are not recorded until the player catches the Pokémon, receives it as a prize/gift or acquires it in a trade.</p>
    <h3>Entries</h3>
    <p>The main feature of any Pokédex are the entries on each individual Pokémon, which provide details that would otherwise be unexplored in the games. Complete entries can only be seen for captured Pokémon, while uncaptured Pokémon only have limited information.</p>
    <h3>Generation I</h3>
    <p>In Generation I's Pokédex (model HANDY505), the entries are simple and each individual section can be accessed directly from the listing. The first, and main option—"Data"—includes an image of the Pokémon, its number, name, category, height, weight, and a short blurb. The second option—"Cry"—does not open a new screen; selecting it simply plays the Pokémon's cry. The last option—"Area"—displays the map, along with flashing indicators at each location where the selected Pokémon can be found; in cases where the Pokémon is not available in the wild, is only available once, or can only be found by fishing or in the Unknown Dungeon, the message "Area Unknown" will be displayed over the center of the map instead. Pokémon Yellow allows players to print entries using the Game Boy Printer.</p>
